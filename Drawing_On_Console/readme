2. Entire screen is an array of Pixel elements. This array variable is named as "screenData".

3. draw line/rectangle on the screen is just to fill in data on certain elements of the array "screenData" 
and display them on the screen via function "draw2Screen".

4. coordinate of a pixel at (x,y) is respective to element array[y][x].

5. to fill color bucket we using recursive with quit condition is "border reaching".

II. Run program.

There is jar file "drawing_program.jar". In console, type: java -jar drawing_program.jar
and input your command like:

C 25 10

L 2 3 2 8

L 2 8 8 8 

R 10 2 20 6

B 8 2 c
